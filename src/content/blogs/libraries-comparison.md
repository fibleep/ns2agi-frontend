LangChain excels when you need to quickly prototype complex LLM applications that integrate with numerous external tools and services. Its maturity means most common problems have documented solutions, making it an excellent choice for teams without the resources to build custom infrastructure.

```python
# LangChain Example: Simple RAG pattern
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator

# Load document and create index
loader = TextLoader("data.txt")
index = VectorstoreIndexCreator().from_loaders([loader])

# Create chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=index.vectorstore.as_retriever()
)

# Query
response = qa_chain.run("What insights can we draw from this data?")
```
</div>

## LangGraph: Stateful Agent Workflows

<div class="animate-fade-in-delay-3">

LangGraph extends LangChain's capabilities by introducing a graph-based approach to LLM orchestration, making it particularly well-suited for complex, multi-step agent workflows.

LangGraph shines in applications requiring sophisticated agent behaviors with multiple decision points and state transitions. It's particularly valuable for applications like conversational agents that need to maintain context over multiple interactions.

```python
# LangGraph Example: Simple agent with state
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage

# Define state
class GraphState:
    messages: list
    current_step: str

# Define nodes
def ask_llm(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = ChatOpenAI().invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": messages + [response]}

def process_response(state):
    # Process the response to determine next step
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if "more information needed" in last_message.content:
        return {"current_step": "ask_for_clarification"}
    return {"current_step": "provide_answer"}

# Build graph
workflow = StateGraph()
workflow.add_node("generate_response", ask_llm)
workflow.add_node("process_response", process_response)
workflow.add_edge("generate_response", "process_response")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "process_response",
    lambda x: x["current_step"],
    {
        "ask_for_clarification": "generate_response",
        "provide_answer": END
    }
)
```
</div>

from haystack.document_stores import ElasticsearchDocumentStore

# Initialize components
document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore()
preprocessor = PreProcessor()
retriever = DensePassageRetriever(document_store)
reader = FARMReader("deepset/roberta-base-squad2")

# Create pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_node(component=retriever, name="Retriever", inputs=["Query"])
pipeline.add_node(component=reader, name="Reader", inputs=["Retriever"])

# Process query
result = pipeline.run(query="What are the main themes in the document?")
```
</div>

LlamaIndex shines when the primary challenge involves efficiently connecting LLMs with proprietary data sources and optimizing retrieval performance.

```python
# LlamaIndex Example: Custom data indexing
from llama_index import GPTVectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.indices.composability import ComposableGraph

# Load and index documents from different sources
financial_docs = SimpleDirectoryReader("./financial").load_data()
technical_docs = SimpleDirectoryReader("./technical").load_data()

financial_index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(financial_docs)
technical_index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(technical_docs)

# Create a composable graph for routing queries
graph = ComposableGraph.from_indices(
    GPTVectorStoreIndex,
    [financial_index, technical_index],
    index_summaries=["Financial reports and analysis", "Technical documentation"]
)

# Query across both indices
response = graph.query(
    "What financial implications do the technical limitations have?",
    text_qa_template=None
)
```
</div>

event_bus = EventBus()

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    name="researcher",
    tools=[WebSearch()],
    event_bus=event_bus,
    memory=Memory(capacity=10)
)

analyst = Agent(
    name="analyst",
    tools=[Calculator()],
    event_bus=event_bus,
    memory=Memory(capacity=5)
)

# Define event subscriptions
researcher.subscribe("research_request", handler=researcher.process_query)
analyst.subscribe("analysis_request", handler=analyst.analyze_data)

# Trigger workflow
event_bus.publish(
    "research_request",
    {"query": "latest market trends in renewable energy"}
)
```
</div>

## AtomicAgents: Belgian Precision Engineering

<div class="animate-fade-in-delay-5">

Developed in Belgium, AtomicAgents takes a unique approach by focusing on composable, fine-grained agent behaviors with strong privacy guarantees aligned with European standards.

### Key Strengths:

from atomicagents.validators import PII, GDPR

# Define a privacy-aware behavior
@Behavior
def process_user_query(agent, query: str):
    # Automatically detect and handle PII
    sanitized_query = GDPR.sanitize_query(query)
    
    # Process with appropriate controls
    with PrivacyControl(retention_period="24h", purpose="user_assistance"):
        response = agent.llm.generate(sanitized_query)
    
    return GDPR.validate_output(response)

# Create agent with privacy controls
support_agent = Agent(
    name="support",
    behaviors=[process_user_query],
    privacy_tier=PrivacyControl.TIER_2,
    data_residency="EU"
)

# Use the agent
result = support_agent.invoke(process_user_query, query="Help with my account")
