                    <p>A few months ago I had a call with a Belgian engineer at a robotics company in Zurich. I asked him: "Why aren't you building in Belgium?" He said "The ecosystem's not ready." Replace "Belgian" with "European" and "Zurich" with "San Francisco".</p>

                    <p>This is the cost of connection — on a local and European level.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-normal text-white mt-12 mb-6 border-b border-white/20 pb-2">The 5x Problem</h2>

                    <p>Every tech job corresponds to 5 more jobs being created. UC Berkeley economist Enrico Morietti analyzed 11 million American workers across 320 metropolitan areas in his book — The New Geography of Jobs.</p>

                    <p>He found that each high-tech job generates 5 additional jobs.</p>

                    <p>In 2024, 128,168 people left Belgium. Assume 10% of that in STEM → <strong class="text-white">12,817.</strong></p>
                    <p>Let's throw in an average salary of €70k for a tech job, <strong class="text-white">€897M</strong>.</p>
                    <p>And then the multiplier effect jobs with a salary of €40k, <strong class="text-white">€2.5B</strong></p>

                    <p>In total we're looking at around <strong class="text-white">€3.4B</strong> in unrealized economic potential.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-normal text-white mt-12 mb-6 border-b border-white/20 pb-2">The STEM Crisis</h2>

                    <p>The problem starts even before employment.</p>

                    <p>According to <a href="https://op.europa.eu/webpub/eac/education-and-training-monitor/en/country-reports/belgium.html" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">European Commission's Education and Training Monitor</a>, STEM university enrollment is at <strong class="text-white">18.7%</strong> compared to EU's <strong class="text-white">26.9%</strong> average.</p>

                    <p>In a class of 30:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/70">
                        <li><strong class="text-white">6</strong> will study STEM</li>
                        <li>Of those 6 only <strong class="text-white">2</strong> will graduate on time</li>
                        <li>The rest will repeat years, switch programs, or drop out</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>There's a problem with starting — and then with finishing. Run the math on ~555,000 university + applied students and you get ~20,900 STEM graduates per year. At the EU-average enrollment rate, we'd have ~30,000. That is <strong class="text-white">9,100 engineers and scientists missing</strong> every single year.</p>

                    <p>The economic loss is not even the most important point. There is the aspect of human capital. These are people who will never mentor an intern, never start a company, and never give their first talk at a local meetup.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-normal text-white mt-12 mb-6 border-b border-white/20 pb-2">The Diagnosis</h2>

                    <p>How many of Belgium's tech problems can be solved by a room full of the right people?</p>

                    <p>Annual reports like the <strong class="text-white">State of Belgian Tech</strong> and <strong class="text-white">State of European Tech</strong> analyze the competitiveness of Belgium and Europe.</p>

                    <p>Here are some quotes from the Belgian report:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/70">
                        <li>High quality talent is missing</li>
                        <li>Entrepreneurship in universities</li>
                        <li>Valorizing ambition</li>
                        <li>Ecosystem attractiveness</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The State of European Tech draws a painful comparison:</p>

                    <p class="text-lg italic text-white/90 border-l-4 border-white/30 pl-6 my-8">
                        "Europe's most mature ecosystems, such as the UK, France, and Germany, reflect decades of investment in tech and as such have created deeper talent pools."
                    </p>

                    <p>The implication is that success is a function of time and volume. History shows that ecosystems exist in two phases: <strong class="text-white">Foundation and Ignition</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Foundation is infrastructure — universities, companies, capital. Ignition is when the right collisions happen often enough to compound.</p>

                    <p>France, the UK, and Germany are already dense. The right people bump into each other by accident.</p>

                    <p>Belgium has the foundation. But the intellectual capital is fragmented across cities, languages and sectors.</p>

                    <p class="text-white font-medium">How do you ignite it?</p>

                    <p>To create a startup, you need a reaction between three key profiles:</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-white/70">
                        <li><strong class="text-white">The Technical</strong> — Ability to deliver</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">The Domain Expert</strong> — Deep knowledge of the problem</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">The Entrepreneur</strong> — Engine coordinating the two worlds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In your city — where do you go to find these profiles? If you can answer this easily, that's great!</p>

                    <p>But if you can't, you just found your bottleneck.</p>

                    <p>So what does it take to change this? We need a solution that creates density <em>without</em> the decades of investment seen in France or the UK.</p>

                    <p>This is something that's been done before.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-normal text-white mt-12 mb-6 border-b border-white/20 pb-2">"Go West, Young Man"</h2>

                    <p>To be honest, I've never known the full story of San Francisco and the Silicon Valley. All I know is the now — A vibrant ecosystem of ambitious people, leaving their countries to pursue a dream.</p>

                    <p>In 1946 there was no dream, there were apricots.</p>

                    <p>Did you know California accounts for approximately 95% of U.S. apricot production? Probably not. There are more interesting things happening there now.</p>

                    <p>There was no way the future of American tech would be conceived in an orchard. All while Route 128, "America's Technology Highway" in Boston was drowning in military contracts, high profile talent and prestige.</p>

                    <p>Frederick Terman dreamed of a different future. How do you compete with Boston? You build something different. He started building the infrastructure for what is today known as the Silicon Valley.</p>

                    <p>First by supporting his two students, Hewlett and Packard with $538 and a garage.</p>

                    <p>Then with Stanford Industrial Park — renting space to companies to remove the friction between students and professionals.</p>

                    <p>The culture of non-competes and admin complexity was left in the East. Things moved faster than ever before. The average tenure was just 2 years.</p>

                    <p>Everything was optimized towards removing the cost of connection and creating collisions.</p>

                    <p>In 1975, 32 hobbyists gathered in what was known as the <em>Homebrew Computer Club.</em></p>

                    <p>A space where techies could share knowledge, swap parts and show off their inventions.</p>

                    <p>At some point an engineer named Steve Wozniak brought a computer to the table, and the rest is history.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg italic text-white/90 border-l-4 border-white/30 pl-6 my-8">
                        "Without computer clubs there would probably be no Apple computers"<br/>

                    <p>Can you identify a <em>Homebrew Computer Club</em> for your profession? In your city or country?</p>

                    <p>Ecosystems are made of dots and lines. An event is a dot while a community is a line. Dots don't compound — lines do.</p>

                    <p>The difference between a stalled ecosystem and a thriving one is whether the same people keep running into each other. Suddenly faces become familiar and turn into co-founders, investors, employees.</p>

                    <p>But when friction is high, these lines never form. Fortunately, friction is something that can be removed at every level.</p>

                    <p><strong class="text-white">The Government</strong> — In the 90s, the Swedish government subsidized home computers. The downstream effect of lowering the barrier to entry was <a href="https://www.klarna.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Klarna</a>.</p>

                    <p class="text-lg italic text-white/90 border-l-4 border-white/30 pl-6 my-8">

                    <p><strong class="text-white">The Infrastructure</strong> — Today, the barrier to entry is being lowered by physical hubs that force density — for example <a href="https://stationf.co/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Station F</a> in Paris, <a href="https://maria.io/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Maria 01</a> in Helsinki and <a href="https://www.wintercircus.be/en" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Wintercircus</a> in Ghent.</p>

                    <p><strong class="text-white">The Community</strong> — The social fabric. Student-led giants like <a href="https://slush.org/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Slush</a> and the <a href="https://www.startglobal.org/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">START Network</a>. Technical labs like the <a href="https://www.ethrobotics.ch/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">ETH Zurich Robotics Club</a>. Organizations like <a href="https://techeurope.io/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">Tech Europe</a> and my beloved <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/north-star-agi" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300">North Star</a> that actively weave the network tighter.</p>

                    <p>When these work in harmony, the lines form on their own.</p>

                    <p>Ecosystem building is a team effort. But ultimately, it comes down to people like you and me who want to see the world in a different way — and take action to shape it.</p>

In just 9 months we organized 12 events and built a community of engineers and entrepreneurs. As we enter 2026, we move beyond just events to building permanent infrastructure — in Belgium and Europe.</p>
